## Overview

### Initial approach

A microbiological researcher in a prominent lab observed that many bacterial species are not well studied, and remain unknown to science. Amongst those may well lie untapped potential resources to enhance human quality of life. Her role in the lab is to discover and document new bacteria with promising attributes. 

The researcher, named Roza, approached us to aide in building an interactive dashboard using scientific data from a study sponsored by the Improbable Beef brand. The database contains detailed information about the bacterial cultures collected from colonies in human belly buttons. Some of these cultures may be suitable for synthesizing protein, while others will not.

### Programmatic Execution

We developed a webpage hosting a dashboard with a variety of plots that were created using Plotly, HTML, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap.

Using [this](https://anaorenstein.github.io/Plotly_deploy/) website, the user can select an anonymous Test Subject ID number from a dropdown menu. Each ID will display:

- The subject's demographic background

-  The subject's belly-washing frequency

- A unique combination of:

  - Bar graph of the top ten bacteria found, the distribution and quantity per bacteria ID number.
  - Bubble plot visualization that shows the number of bacteria cultures per sample per bacteria ID.

  

## Results

### Interactive HTML Dashboard

The interactive dashboard that was created can be used by the volunteers, or research subjects who wish to look up the results of their own culture, as well as the scientific community and fellow researcher who wish to complement and collaborate on more research.

Going forward, similar studies can be integrated and combined to this scientific dataset. The HTML dashboard can be enhanced, and more complex structures may be added to our HTML template.
